# Weather Forecast
This is a homework assignment where I had to use a weather api to gather data, convert that data, and load it into the page.

## Description
This website use the open weather map api to retrieve data and display it in the form of a daily forecast and 5 day forecast. It uses local storage to store the input data to load the last searched city's forecast.

[Here is the link](https://tywalter.github.io/weather-forecast/) to the deployed website.

## Usage
This is intended to gather current weather and a 5 day forecast and return the results for the city you select or type in. This is also for grading purposes.

## Acknowledgments
Thank you to [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for allowing me to use their weather api.
